Fizzbuzz in IO
==============

In preparation for understanding Javascript better, the teaching staff at Makers Academy asked us to create the FizzBuzz game in the IO language.

The game methods can be found in the fizzbuzz-game.io file and the test methods can be found in the fizzbuzz-test.io file.

How to set it up
